# Landing-Page
TOP Landing Page Flexbox project
A landing page around the subject of stoicism. 
Not a full, functioning website. There are no actual external links. The main purpose of this project was the CSS flexbox styling.

What I gained from this project:
* Compartamentalization skills that's needed for flexbox
