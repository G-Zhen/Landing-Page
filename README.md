# Landing-Page
TOP Landing Page Flexbox project.
A landing page around the subject of stoicism. 
Not a full, functioning website. The sign up buttons don't actually do anything. The main purpose of this project was the CSS flexbox styling.

Why Stoicism? It's what I've been into recently on my self-improvement journey. It's powerful stuff. Programming itself actually encompasses a core value of stoicism: the idea of small parts that each have their own purpose coming together to form a Whole that will then carry out a greater purpose. 

What I gained from this project:
* Compartamentalization skills that's needed for flexbox
* Actualizing my design using the technical aspects of CSS
* Task management skills in keeping track of HTML and CSS components in conjunction
* Web design basics
* Problem solving skills: breaking the idea of an entire web site into small chunks that will eventually form a full site

Languages used:
* HTML
* CSS
  * flexbox
