# Landing-Page
TOP Landing Page Flexbox project.
A landing page around the subject of stoicism. 
Not a full, functioning website. There are no actual external links. The main purpose of this project was the CSS flexbox styling.

Why Stoicism? It's what I've been into recently on my self-improvement journey. It's powerful stuff.

What I gained from this project:
* Compartamentalization skills that's needed for flexbox
* Task management skills in keeping track of HTML and CSS components in conjunction
* Web design basics

Languages used:
* HTML
* CSS
  *flexbox
